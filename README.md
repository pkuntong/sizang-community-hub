# 🌐 Sizang Community Hub

**A private, multilingual digital home for the global Sizang (Siyin) community.**

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The **Sizang Community Hub** is a secure, community-driven platform built for the **Sizang (Siyin) tribe**, an ethnic Chin group originally from Myanmar. It is designed as an alternative to generic platforms like Facebook or Reddit — providing a **safe, culturally-focused, and self-managed space** for Sizang people around the world to connect, share, and preserve their identity.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

> "This is more than a forum. It’s a digital homeland."

The Sizang community is dispersed across Myanmar, India, the U.S., Australia, and other regions. Existing platforms don’t protect our cultural integrity, nor do they offer true community control. This project empowers the Sizang people to:
- Reclaim their online presence
- Preserve their language and stories
- Connect youth with elders
- Build a future rooted in heritage

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Forum discussions (Culture, Religion, Youth, Migration, etc.)
- ✅ User profiles with roles (admin, moderator, member)
- ✅ Private groups (e.g., Sizang Youth, Bible Study, Elders’ Stories)
- ✅ Invite-only or public registration
- ✅ Media sharing: text, photos, audio, and video
- ✅ Mobile-first, responsive design
- ✅ Multilingual interface (English, Sizang/Chin, Burmese)
- ✅ Secure authentication and moderation tools
